# URL Shortener - based on ruby-on-rails \#fun

## Introduction

> So instead of me using __NodeJS__ and __ExpressJS__ + __MongoDB__, which by the way would've been easier...
> I decided to just break my brain in the process and learn how to use **Passenger**, **NGINX**, **Ruby-on-rails** and **PostgreSQL**.

> Also, I had to use __*Capistrano*__ to fully deploy my app, which honestly was kinda dumb on my part but whatever XD
> It works, why bother making it harder for me right?

> Well the only reason I made it like this is because I wanted to learn all of it. So in reality, it is pretty helpful that I did it this way!
